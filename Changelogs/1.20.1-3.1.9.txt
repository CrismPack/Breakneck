Config changes: 
= Replaced LargeImageKey with its GIF variant: [Simple Discord RPC]
= Replaced SmallImageKey with an image of the Crism Modpacks logo: [Simple Discord RPC]
= Hovering the mouse over the small icon will also no longer say the amount of mods installed. This is due to that number being heavily inflated and not very useful: [Simple Discord RPC]
= Now just says "In %world%" instead of "Currently in %world%": [Simple Discord RPC]
= Now overwrites the description when in the Overworld to say "In the Overworld": [Simple Discord RPC]
= Button now links to the Breakneck wiki page, which has links to both the CurseForge and Modrinth edition: [Simple Discord RPC]
